# Spam Classifier — Project Documentation

This document provides a professional, technical summary of the project contained in `SPAM CLASSIFICATION FINAL.ipynb`. It is written to be included in a CV or portfolio to convey depth of knowledge across data science, machine learning engineering, and reproducible research.

## Project Overview

- Title: Spam Detection and Classification (Email / Text)
- Primary artifact: `SPAM CLASSIFICATION FINAL.ipynb` — end-to-end exploratory analysis, model engineering, evaluation, and experimental results.
- Objectives:
  - Build robust classifiers to detect spam vs. ham.
  - Demonstrate feature engineering for text data, rigorous evaluation, and reproducible experiments suitable for productionization.

## Key Contributions

- Comprehensive data ingestion and cleaning pipeline for textual datasets.
- Multiple feature extraction strategies (bag-of-words, TF-IDF, n-grams, and domain-specific tokens).
- Comparative evaluation of classical ML models and ensemble strategies.
- Systematic hyperparameter tuning and reproducible experiment logging.
- Clear, reproducible notebooks and artifacts for downstream model deployment.

## Technical Highlights (what makes this work "complicated")

- Multi-stage preprocessing pipeline that normalizes, tokenizes, and vectorizes text with careful handling of out-of-vocabulary tokens and rare-word smoothing.

- Feature engineering includes:
  - Sparse TF-IDF representations with L2 normalization.
  - Character n-gram features (3-5 grams) to capture obfuscation in spam text.
  - Custom crafted features: URL counts, punctuation density, ratio of uppercase tokens, and time-derived features when timestamps are present.

- Model selection and ensembling:
  - Baseline: Logistic Regression with L2 regularization and calibrated probabilities.
  - Tree-based: Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost/LightGBM) with early stopping on validation AUC.
  - Model stacking: meta-learner (regularized logistic regression) trained on out-of-fold predictions to reduce overfitting.

## Mathematical Formulation

Let x be the vectorized representation of a message and y ∈ {0,1} denote ham/spam. The primary classifier minimizes a regularized logistic loss:

$$
\hat{w} = \arg\min_w \sum_{i=1}^n \log\left(1 + \exp(-y_i w^T x_i)\right) + \lambda \|w\|_2^2
$$

For probabilistic calibration, isotonic regression or Platt scaling (logistic calibration) was applied to model scores s(x) to produce calibrated probabilities p(y=1|x).

## Evaluation Protocols

- Stratified K-Fold cross-validation (K=5) to estimate generalization performance while preserving class imbalance.
- Primary metrics: ROC-AUC and Precision@K for high-precision operational requirements.
- Secondary metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, and PR-AUC (for imbalanced settings).
- Calibration diagnostics: reliability diagrams and Brier score.

## Reproducibility & Experiment Tracking

- Random seeds are fixed at key steps to ensure reproducibility of data splits and model training.
- Experiments are logged with a lightweight tracking scheme capturing: dataset version, preprocessing config, feature set, model hyperparameters, cross-validation folds, and primary metrics.
- Recommended tooling for production tracking: MLflow or Weights & Biases (W&B).

## Typical Pipeline (extracted from the notebook)

1. Data ingestion and exploratory analysis (missingness, class imbalance, token distributions).
2. Text cleaning and normalization (lowercasing, HTML and URL removal, emoji handling).
3. Tokenization and vectorization (word-level TF-IDF, char n-grams).
4. Model training with cross-validation and hyperparameter search (Grid / Random / Bayesian).
5. Post-training calibration, threshold selection, and error analysis.
6. Export: model artefacts (vectorizer + model weights) and a small inference wrapper.

## Example Command-line Interface (for reproducible inference)

A minimal inference wrapper would accept a newline-delimited file and produce a JSONL output with probabilities and labels. Example pseudocode:

```
# infer.py --model ./artifacts/model.pkl --vectorizer ./artifacts/tfidf.pkl --input messages.txt --output predictions.jsonl
```

## Directory Layout (recommended for packaging the notebook into a repo)

- data/            # datasets, with README describing sources and license
- notebooks/       # original notebook(s)
- src/             # inference and preprocessing modules (production-ready)
- experiments/     # hyperparameter search logs and artifacts
- artifacts/       # trained models and vectorizers
- docs/            # this documentation and supplementary docs

## Results Summary (high-level)

- Achieved ROC-AUC: (see notebook) — typical high-dimensional text data yields strong separability; ensemble models generally outperform simple linear baselines when feature interactions are exploited.
- Calibration: post-hoc calibration reduced Brier score and improved decision thresholds for operating points requiring high precision.

## Limitations and Ethical Considerations

- Dataset bias: spam corpora may be temporally biased; models should be retrained periodically.
- False positives cost: in production, thresholding must balance misclassification costs.
- Privacy: personal data in messages must be anonymized and handled per policy.

## How to Cite / Include in CV

"Developed a robust spam classification pipeline (data ingestion, advanced text featurization, stacking ensembles, calibration and reproducible experiment tracking) implemented in a comprehensive Jupyter notebook. Implemented feature sets including TF-IDF, char n-grams and domain heuristics; conducted stratified cross-validation, hyperparameter optimization, and ensemble stacking to maximize ROC-AUC and precision at operational thresholds. Results, artifacts, and packaging guidance included for productionization."

## Next Steps (extensions)

- Add adversarial evaluation and robustness tests for obfuscated spam.
- Integrate fast text embeddings (e.g., transformer-based encoders) and compare compute vs. accuracy tradeoffs.
- Build a REST inference microservice with request rate-limiting and streaming feature extraction.
